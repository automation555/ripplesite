In the fork I'm working on at 

http://github.com/tphyahoo/ripplesite/commits/rippledeals

I am disabling ripplepay's interest features, in anticipation of the website eventually being essentially an accounting and social networking front end, and payment routing taking place on what I am calling rippled, the ripple server. Once that's in place, I might then re-enable interest payments, but in a more flexible way. EG, this might allow such things as net-30, net-60 () like at

eg http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?t=432424 ("2% 10 days Net 30, which means deduct 2% if you pay within 10 days, full balance due in 30 from invoice date")

rather than the rather rigid interest model currently in place. Essentially, interest should be seen as an incentive to settle debts, but there's many ways to do it. 

By the way the main reason I'm disabling interest is something seems to have broken when I upgraded django when I view a connections detail, so I'm just taking the easy way out and disabling this functionality, since this is something I was considering doing anyway.

I'm curious how
